# Replication Package for SBQS 2025 Technical Track

This repository contains the replication package for the paper submitted to the SBQS 2025 technical track. The goal is to provide all data, code, and artifacts necessary to reproduce the experiments described in the paper.

## Repository Structure

- **replication_package_dataset.xlsx**  
  Spreadsheet with data and relevant information for replicating the experiments.

- **dslist/**  
  Java project containing the target classes and 11 test files. Each test file was generated from a different prompt technique template, allowing comparison between automated test generation approaches.

- **java-cas-client/**  
  Additional Java project containing other target classes and their respective 11 test files, also generated from the different prompt technique templates.

- **templates/**  
  Contains the 11 prompt templates used for test generation. Each template corresponds to a distinct prompting technique or approach.

## Experiment Description

For each target class in the `dslist` and `java-cas-client` projects, 11 test files were generated, each using one of the templates available in the `templates` folder. This allows evaluation of the impact of different prompting techniques on automated test generation.

## How to Reproduce

1. **Requirements**  
   - Java (version compatible with the projects)
   - Build tool (Maven or Gradle, as specified in the projects)
   - Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA

2. **Compiling and Running the Tests**  
   - Navigate to the desired project folder (`dslist` or `java-cas-client`).
   - Run the tests using the appropriate command for the project's build tool.
   - Example with Maven:
     ```sh
     mvn test
     ```

3. **Analyzing the Results**  
   - Compare the results of the tests generated by each prompt technique.
   - Use the `replication_package_dataset.xlsx` spreadsheet to cross-reference data and analyze the experiments.
